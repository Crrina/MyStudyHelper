# MyStudyHelper
MyStudyHelper is a fullstack application made using SpringBoot, SQL (PostgreSQL), React, Javascript and pure CSS. It uses JWT for authentication and spring security. Note that the application.properties is empty for security reason and if you wish to run the app on localhost you will need your own PostreSQL server and complete application.properties with your own database details.
